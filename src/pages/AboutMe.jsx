          <p>
            My name is Vlada Cab√°n (Eliseeva). I was born and raised in Omsk, Russia where I attended Omsk State
            Technical University majoring in Computer Science. In 2009, I moved to the USA and transferred to CUNY Brooklyn College a year later. I graduated in 2014 with a BS in Computer Science. I am currently working in the Fashion industry overseeing Sourcing and Product Development of apparel. My true passion is coding and
            problem solving. I am currently attending Coding Bootscamp at Columbia University and open to work on
            web development projects. Please feel free to contact me to discuss any projects I could help with.
